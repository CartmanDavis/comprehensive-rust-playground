# Rust Playground

A personal Rust playground for experimenting with concepts from the [Comprehensive Rust](https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/) course.

## Project Structure

- `src/bin/` — Rust source files
- `Cargo.toml` — project manifest
- `Cargo.lock` — locked dependencies

## Running examples

- This repo is full of small, independent files.
  - They are all located in `src/bin/`.
- Run `cargo run --bin <name_of_file>` (without the `*.rs` suffix) to execute a file
